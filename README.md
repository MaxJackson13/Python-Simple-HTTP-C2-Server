Have you ever wanted to over complicate remote code execution? Now you can. `Server.py` will listen on a user specified port (default 8000) for HTTP GET requests with a base64 encoded cookie containing a command to run on the remote machine. It uses `subprocess.Popen` to spawn a new process, execute the command, and retrieve the results, separate from the process the server is running in.
